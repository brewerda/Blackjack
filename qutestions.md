1. My program does not split and you can bet after the round has started.  This occurs because I did not get time to add enablers into my code.
2. I believe that my code is unique in the fact that it has a scoreboard that follows the games won by both the dealer and player.
3. Classes in java are helpful when creating complicated programs because the allow you to separate our your work and it makes your code easier to follow.
4. private is something that cannot be globally changed. It is an int, variable, etc, that can be locally changed and called upon in any class file. A public variable/int is one that can only be called on in 1 file and not carried over to others.
5. The difference between class and instance is that a class variable can be called on in a "private" in any file. An instance variable can only be called in one specific file
6. Inheritance is where a base model of something is created and those attributes can be called on and passed down. It is beneficial so that your code does not become repetative when base codes become extended.
7. "this" is a keyword where you can locally change a private int/variable.  Super is an important feature that runs all of the code prior to it before continuing on with the rest of the method.
8. All objects must have a behavior and a state.
9. I am still confused a little on inheritance.  The code once i got t working was easy but starting off was a little difficult.
